# Aerial Ops Challenge

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Then, run the app:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## User Table

The table is located in `src/components/UserTable/index.tsx`. The mock data is inside `mock.ts` in the same folder.

I also created the `Document` and `DocumentList` components to keep the code simpler.

The `DocumentList` component contains the logic for the requested breakpoint behavior.
